# Hospital-Data-Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel by creating a dashboard that gives insights to the analyse Hospital Data that I got from Kaggle. The process involved creating pivot tables, visualization and an addition of a V-look-up function than can be used to look-up for a condition and the cost of treatment.
