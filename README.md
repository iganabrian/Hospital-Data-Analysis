# Hospital-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)

## Proect objectives
I got the Hopital Data from Kaglle and I wanted to explore the data and understand it. 

## Questions
-What is the total number of patients recorded?

-What is the average age of patients?

-What is the average satisfaction from the hospital care?

-What is average length of stay in hospital?

-What is the total number of conditions recorded?

-Which is condition has the highest treatment cost? Â 

## Dashboard

## Process
-Very data for any missing values and anomalies (I realized the data was clean so I just loaded the data into Power Query just incase I needed to do future changes.

-Created Pivot Tables acording to the questions I imposed on myself.

-Merged all Pivot Tables into one Dashboard and applied slicers to make it DYNAMIC.

-I added a V-look up function so as to make it easer to confirm the cost of a specific condition and its medical treatment.

-I added a sidebar to the left of all sheets so that to make the navigation esier.
